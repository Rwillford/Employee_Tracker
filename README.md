## My Story

I set up the file system and installed the three packages needed for this assignment<br>
I created my database of business followed by my schema and seed sql files<br>
Next, it was time to conquer the js file to make this whole app work<br>
I created my connection to the database then my main menu with a switch statement to all the other function in the app. 
Finally I created all the function needed for this assignment plus a couple of the bonus ones as well

Here Is a video fo it working:
